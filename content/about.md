Hej everyone, 
My name is Jayan Wijesingha, and my friends called me "Jay". I am final year PhD candidate and research assistant at Universit√§t Kassel, Witzenhausen campus. My current focus is *the application of UAV-borne remote sensing for temperate grassland management*.

Since I work with geospatial data, I love to make beautiful maps and graphs using **R** programming language and free & open source **GIS** software.

I am from Kesbewa, a small town near Colombo, Sri Lanka. Before I come to Witzenhausen where I currently live, I studied in Belihuloya, Sri Lanka & in Lund, Sweden and worked in Bangkok, Thailand and Copenhagen, Denmark. 

I am a lovely husband to my wife **Anu** and father to our little **Yevon**.
