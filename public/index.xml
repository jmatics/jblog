      <description>Hej everyone, My name is Jayan Wijesingha, and my friends called me &amp;ldquo;Jay&amp;rdquo;. I am final year PhD candidate and research assistant at Universit√§t Kassel, Witzenhausen campus. My current focus is the application of UAV-borne remote sensing for temperate grassland management.
Since I work with geospatial data, I love to make beautiful maps and graphs using R programming language and free &amp;amp; open source GIS software.
I am from Kesbewa, a small town near Colombo, Sri Lanka.</description>

r ggplot2 libraryr base plots (using codes from The R Graph Gallery)This data is sample data set from my colleague.</description>
