      <description>This tutorial will guide to create 3D point cloud, Digitla Elevation Model (DEM), and Ortho-Mosaic from your UAV-borne RGB images (e.g. DJI FC330). This tutorial use Agisoft PhotoScan software.
Image exportCopy camera images (JPGs) to the local folder in your computer from the micro SD card of the drone.Right click one of the image and click the properties and check the location data under the GPS section in the ‘Detail’ tab.</description>

      <description>Hej everyone, My name is Jayan Wijesingha, and my friends called me &amp;ldquo;Jay&amp;rdquo;. I am final year PhD candidate and research assistant at Universität Kassel, Witzenhausen campus. My current focus is the application of UAV-borne remote sensing for temperate grassland management.
Since I work with geospatial data, I love to make beautiful maps and graphs using R programming language and free &amp;amp; open source GIS software.
I am from Kesbewa, a small town near Colombo, Sri Lanka.</description>

      <description>Last week my colleague showed me a drawn graph and asked can we plot this kind of graph. It is a graph with grouped boxplot. Additionally, it contains a trend line that connects mean of each data box. So this post explains how to draw a graph like that using two ways;
r ggplot2 libraryr base plots (using codes from The R Graph Gallery)This data is sample data set from my colleague.</description>
